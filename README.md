# Introduction to CSDUL

This repository contains the key documents that govern the operation of CSDUL. These documents explain various processes associated with the project. They include:

- **Coding Standards**: Guidelines and protocols for coding within the project. It defines rules for naming conventions, formatting, and structuring code to ensure consistency and accuracy across the system.
  
- **Process to Add Inputs into CSDUL**: This document outlines how new data or inputs are incorporated into the CSDUL system. It includes steps for validation, formatting, and quality assurance to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

### Data Sources
These are the various sources of information used in the CSDUL system.

### Generate
Nodes generate social health indicators based on the input data.

### Validate
The Hub verifies inputs to ensure their correctness. Any issues identified are flagged and corrected at an early stage to maintain data integrity.

### CSDUL – Load
The Hub loads the validated inputs into CSDUL.

### CSDUL – Integrate
CSDUL components are integrated to generate new health indicators and analyses.
